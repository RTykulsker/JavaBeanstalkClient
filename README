This is JavaBeanstalkClient, a Java Client for beanstalkd

See http://xph.us/software/beanstalkd for general info

To build JavaBeanstalkClient, type "mvn install"

To use, simply add the dependency to your POM:
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.surftools</groupId>
  <artifactId>BeanstalkClient</artifactId>
  <version>1.7.0</version>
</dependency>

This client library is designed to operate with other client libraries; 
hence jobs are opaque byte arrays, job ids require the use of a Java long (to support 
unsigned ints up to 2**32), etc. 

The implementation of the library is based upon the design of the Python beanstalkc at
http://github.com/earl/beanstalkc/tree/master

Documentation on how to use Beanstalkd is available at
see https://github.com/kr/beanstalkd/blob/master/doc/protocol.txt
and
http://github.com/earl/beanstalkc/tree/master

updated to work with beanstalkd 1.12; reserve-job command implemented
